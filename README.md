# Time Series Demo

This project is a practical exploration of time-series decomposition, aimed at deepening my understanding of the fundamentals of this important topic. Through this project, I am committed to showcasing my proficiency in applying time-series decomposition techniques to real-world data, and producing a concise yet insightful analysis that serves as a valuable reference for revising these concepts.

In this project, I leverage the power of time-series decomposition to gain insights from historical data and uncover hidden patterns, trends, and seasonality. By employing well-established decomposition methods, I extract meaningful components from the time-series data and visualize them to better understand the underlying patterns and make informed decisions.

The project includes an IPython notebook (`analysis.ipynb`) that demonstrates step-by-step how I perform time-series decomposition on a dataset (`aep_hourly.csv`) using Python. The code is well-documented, accompanied by explanatory comments, and follows best practices for reproducibility and maintainability. Additionally, a `requirements.txt` file is provided to ensure that users can easily install the required packages and reproduce the analysis in their own environment.

With this project, I aim to showcase my proficiency in time-series decomposition, demonstrate my analytical skills, and provide a valuable resource for others interested in learning or revising this topic.
